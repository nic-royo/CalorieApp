# CalorieApp
Back-end website done with heavy use of Node.js and SQL practices and simple HTML elements. Allows users to write food items into a database, which can then be updated, meaning items can be deleted, changed, or added. 
-IMPORTANT- This project was done as part of a course where we used VS 2019 as a virtual environment run in the browser instead of the app. Because of this, running the app on the desktop app can provide multiple errors.
